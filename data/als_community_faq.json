This is dangerous. BiPAP helps push out the CO₂ while also helping breathe in.\n\n**Signs that BiPAP is needed:**\n• Morning headaches (CO₂ buildup sign)\n• Feeling tired even after sleeping\n• Breathlessness while lying down\n• Gasping or disturbed sleep\n• Daytime drowsiness/confusion\n• SpO₂ dropping below 90%\n\n**Comparison: Oxygen Only vs BiPAP**\n\n| Aspect | Oxygen Only | BiPAP |\n|--------|-------------|-------|\n| O₂ levels | Improves | Improves |\n| CO₂ removal | No help | Helps exhale |\n| Safe for PALS | Risky alone | Recommended |\n\n**Approximate Costs (India):**\n• BiPAP rental: ₹1,500-3,000/month\n• O₂ concentrator rental: ₹1,000-2,500/month",

Morning headaches (indicates CO2 buildup)\n4. Excessive daytime sleepiness\n5. Cannot sleep flat - needs 2-3 pillows\n6. Difficulty completing long sentences\n7.

Many PALS have normal daytime readings but drop to 85-88% during sleep.\n\n**What to do:**\n1. Get overnight pulse oximetry or sleep study\n2. If SpO2 drops below 93-94% at night, push for BiPAP\n3. Buy a good pulse oximeter (₹1,500-3,000) for home monitoring",
