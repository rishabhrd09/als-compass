Start BiPAP immediately.\n\n**IF** PALS cannot lie flat and needs to sleep sitting up **→ THEN** Diaphragm muscles are weakening. BiPAP support is needed NOW.\n\n**IF** waiting for doctor to say 'now is the time' **→ THEN** This rarely happens. YOU must recognize the signs and act.\n\n### ⚠️ Critical Understanding:\nIn ALS, the problem is NOT oxygen getting in - it's CO₂ getting OUT. Weak diaphragm muscles prevent proper exhalation. SpO₂ can be 97% while CO₂ reaches dangerous levels. Pulse oximeters CANNOT detect CO₂ retention.\n\n### 💡 The Hard Lesson (Hindsight):\n'We waited because SpO₂ was fine. Then emergency tracheostomy. If we had started BiPAP when morning headaches began, we could have avoided this.'\n\n### 🇮🇳 Action Steps:\n1. Arrange BiPAP within 48 hours\n2. BiPAP rental: ₹2,000-3,000/month | Purchase: ₹40,000-80,000\n3. Ensure it has ST mode with AVAPS feature\n4. Start using during sleep first",

        {
            "principle": "The Reverse Principle",
            "explanation": "In ALS, using support DOES NOT make muscles lazy. It's the REVERSE. The less fatigue we give to the body, the better we deal with ALS. Early support PRESERVES strength."

        {
            "principle": "BiPAP = Gym Rest for Diaphragm",
            "explanation": "BiPAP is not about oxygen - it's about giving rest to the tired diaphragm muscles. Like taking breaks at the gym prevents muscle burnout."
        },
        {
            "principle": "Positivity vs Practicality",
            "explanation": "It's good to stay positive. But sometimes positivity becomes delusion and we avoid being practical. ALS progression punishes delay, not preparedness."
        },
        {
            "principle": "No Doctor Will Say 'Now'",
            "explanation": "There is NO doctor who will tell you 'now is the right time.' YOU must recognize the signs and act. Doctors often look at SpO₂ only and miss CO₂ retention."

            "principle": "Support Early, Not in Crisis",
            "explanation": "Emergency interventions are traumatic and riskier than planned ones. Anticipate, don't react."
