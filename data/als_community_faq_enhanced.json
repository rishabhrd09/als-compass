                    "answer": "**Take a deep breath.** Many families in our community were in the same place. Here's what helped them get organized:\n\n**Week 1 Priorities:**\n\n1. **Join a support community** - Introduce yourself, mention your city, current symptoms, and stage. The community will guide based on your specific situation.\n\n2. **Get baseline assessments done:**\n   • FVC (lung function test) - critical for respiratory planning\n   • Swallowing assessment\n   • Overall strength evaluation\n\n3. **Start researching equipment NOW** - Even if you don't need it today. When you need a BiPAP at 2 AM urgently, you don't want to be searching for vendors.\n\n4. **Involve your PALS in all decisions** - Many patients feel they've lost control. Keeping them involved helps emotionally.\n\n5. **Don't Google too much initially** - It will scare you with worst-case scenarios. Real families have PALS living 5, 8, even 10+ years with good care.",

                    "answer": "**Key Understanding:** In ALS, the problem is NOT oxygen getting in, but CO₂ (carbon dioxide) getting OUT. When breathing muscles weaken, CO₂ builds up in the blood. Plain oxygen can mask this problem - SpO₂ may look normal while CO₂ reaches dangerous levels.\n\n**BiPAP works differently:** It pushes air in (helps oxygen) AND helps push CO₂ out by supporting the breathing muscles.\n\n**DEFINITE SIGNS (act immediately):**\n• Cannot lie flat - needs 2-3 pillows or sleeps in recliner (orthopnea)\n• Waking up with headaches (CO₂ building up at night)\n• SpO₂ dropping below 94% at any time\n• Feeling breathless at rest or while talking\n\n**EARLY WARNING SIGNS (start planning):**\n• More tired than usual, sleeping more during day\n• Morning grogginess that doesn't go away\n• Difficulty completing long sentences without pausing\n• Yawning frequently (body trying to get more oxygen)\n• Weak cough - can't clear throat properly\n\n**Oxygen Only vs BiPAP:**\n| Aspect | Oxygen Only | BiPAP |\n|--------|-------------|-------|\n| Increases O₂ | Yes | Yes |\n| Removes CO₂ | NO | YES |\n| Supports breathing muscles | NO | YES |\n| Safe for ALS alone | RISKY | RECOMMENDED |",

                    "answer": "**NO, don't wait!** This is a common mistake.\n\n**Why these signs matter:**\n• Can't sleep flat (orthopnea) = earliest sign of diaphragm weakness\n• Breathlessness with activity = respiratory muscles struggling\n\n**The Hidden Problem:** Daytime SpO₂ may be fine, but it drops significantly at night when diaphragm works harder. Many PALS have normal daytime readings but drop to 85-88% during sleep.\n\n**What to do:**\n1. Get overnight pulse oximetry or sleep study\n2. If SpO₂ drops below 93-94% at night, push for BiPAP\n3. Buy a good pulse oximeter (₹1,500-3,000) for home monitoring",

This should be THEIR decision.\n\n4. **CARE REQUIREMENTS:** Trach requires regular suctioning, tube changes, 24/7 trained caregiver. Ensure this can be arranged before proceeding.",

Wash hands well, wear gloves\n2. Pour 1ml Normal Saline into the trach tube (directly into the hole). This loosens secretions. Patient may cough - that's normal!\n3. Connect Ambu bag and give 4-5 gentle squeezes. This pushes the saline around and brings up secretions.\n4. Turn on suction machine. Disconnect from ventilator/BiPAP.\n5. Insert suction catheter into trach tube - DON'T apply suction while going in.\n6. NOW apply suction (thumb on hole) and slowly withdraw while rotating. Takes about 8-10 seconds.\n7. Immediately reconnect to BiPAP/ventilator.\n8. Let patient rest 30-60 seconds. Repeat if needed.\n\n**WATCH OUT FOR:**\n• SpO₂ dropping below 85% - stop and connect to Ambu immediately\n• Catheter not going in - don't force, try smaller size\n• Lots of blood - stop, call doctor",

Gently insert and rotate.\n\n**HOW TO PREVENT BLOCKAGES:**\n• Flush 30-50ml water BEFORE every feed\n• Flush 70-100ml water AFTER every feed (most important!)\n• Don't give very thick feeds - thin them down\n• Crush medications very finely, use liquid medications when possible",
