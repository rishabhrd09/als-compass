            "description": "Being positive is good for both PALS and CALS. It helps us stay strong and hopeful. But at the same time, at least one family member should stay practical when it comes to making important decisions. As PALS and CALS, we often feel that we will beat this disease. We don't want to think negatively. We feel we will never need BiPAP, PEG tube, or any supportive devices. But sometimes, too much positivity keeps us in a kind of delusion. We also worry that if we start using supportive devices, we will become dependent on them and destroy our body's natural capacity. This thinking is correct to some extent. But it can also make us delay important decisions and miss the right time to act. In ALS, we should not overexert the body. Using support devices like BiPAP, wheelchair, and feeding tubes actually helps reduce muscle fatigue and preserves strength for longer."

Even after reading messages and knowing the signs, actually making the decision feels very different — these are new, unfamiliar things that can feel scary.</p><p>What seems obvious to those already using BiPAP is not obvious to those facing the decision for the first time. It's only after you start using it that you realize: \"This wasn't as difficult as I feared, and I wish we had started earlier.\"</p><p>This is completely natural. But positivity can sometimes become a barrier to timely action.

Delaying BiPAP exhausts muscles faster.</li></ul><p><strong>The Reality:</strong> In ALS, the less fatigue we give to breathing muscles, the better.</p><h4>Waiting for Doctors to Decide</h4><p>Many families wait for doctors to tell them when to start BiPAP. This can be risky because even experienced doctors may have limited ALS experience and might focus only on SpO₂ levels, missing early warning signs like difficulty sleeping flat or morning headaches. Ideally, they should also assess diaphragm muscle strength, not just lung condition.</p>",

Wipe saliva from mouth and face frequently.</p><p><strong>Positioning</strong><br>Keep head slightly elevated. Side-lying helps drainage. Avoid lying flat as it increases pooling.</p><p><strong>Oral Suctioning</strong><br>Use Yankauer suction tip with a portable machine (Yuwell or similar). Provides immediate relief through frequent, gentle oral suctioning. Keep suction machine nearby at all times.</p><p><strong>Oral Care</strong><br>Maintain excellent dental hygiene and keep the mouth moist with frequent sips of water (if safe to swallow) or mouth spray to prevent thick, sticky secretions.</p><p><strong>Medications (Consult Doctor)</strong><br>Glycopyrrolate → Reduces secretions (use cautiously, can thicken chest secretions).</p><p><strong>Absorbent Products</strong><br>Power Drool bibs/pads (available from Romsons).</p><p><strong>Dietary Changes</strong><br>Reduce dairy intake (can thicken saliva).</p>",

Key points to know:</p><ul><li>High BP during illness may be due to breathing difficulty, not hypertension</li><li>BP medications can cause rapid sodium loss through frequent urination</li><li>Recovery from severe imbalance takes time, sometimes weeks</li><li>Sudden electrolyte drop can cause serious damage</li></ul><h4>How Often to Check Electrolytes</h4><table class=\"faq-table\"><thead><tr><th>When</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Routine</td><td>Once a month</td></tr><tr><td>Immediately</td><td>If symptoms appear, or after diarrhea/vomiting</td></tr><tr><td>More Frequently</td><td>If on diuretics (Dytor) or BP medications</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Note:</strong> Normal sodium is around 135. Once PALS lose muscle mass, maintaining 135 becomes difficult. Track monthly levels to know your PALS's personal normal range.</p><h4>Key Symptoms to Watch For</h4><p>Low sodium (hyponatremia) is the most common issue.</p><p><strong>Early Warning Signs:</strong></p><ul><li>Unusual drowsiness or being dull and inactive</li><li>Loss of appetite</li><li>Feeling cold, especially hands and feet</li><li>Low blood pressure</li><li>Low heart rate (50-60) with reduced responsiveness</li></ul><p><strong>Serious Signs (Act Urgently):</strong></p><ul><li>Low body temperature (can drop to 94°F)</li><li>Cold body with sweating at the same time</li><li>Confusion, disorientation, or difficulty waking up</li><li>Very low BP that doesn't respond to usual measures</li><li>Semi-consciousness</li></ul><div class=\"warning-box\"><strong>Important:</strong> If your PALS seems dull and inactive, suspect low electrolytes first. Either do a blood test or give ORS/coconut water immediately.</div><h4>Daily Prevention</h4><ul><li>Give coconut water daily (rich in potassium)</li><li>Include potassium-rich foods: tomatoes, bananas</li><li>Give ORS, especially when PALS demands water at night or early morning</li><li>Ensure adequate fluids through PEG</li><li>Add a pinch of extra salt to every feed</li></ul><h4>Practical Tips</h4><ul><li>Taste the food/feeds to check if there is enough salt</li><li>If on diuretics or BP medications, monitor electrolytes more frequently</li><li>Keep ORS packets at home always</li><li>Watch for frequent urination - this depletes sodium quickly</li></ul><div class=\"recommendation-box\"><strong>Caution:</strong> High electrolytes are also dangerous. Do not overdo salt or potassium. Balance is important.</div><h4>What to Do During Diarrhea or Vomiting</h4><p>Illness causes rapid electrolyte loss. Act quickly:</p><ul><li>Start ORS immediately, do not wait</li><li>Add coconut water to feeds</li><li>Switch to simple foods (curd rice, khichdi)</li><li>Get electrolyte test if symptoms persist beyond 24 hours</li><li>Consult doctor if illness does not stop</li></ul><h4>When to Seek Help</h4><p>Get electrolyte test immediately if:</p><ul><li>Symptoms from above sections appear</li><li>PALS seems dull and inactive without clear reason</li></ul><p><strong>Tests to request:</strong> Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium</p><p>Seek medical help immediately if symptoms are severe or don't improve with ORS and fluids.</p><h4>A Note on Hospital/ICU Stays</h4><p>Electrolyte imbalance can happen in hospitals too, often because proper feeds are not given. If your PALS is admitted:</p><ul><li>Ask about feeding schedule and salt content</li><li>Request regular electrolyte monitoring</li><li>Do not assume the hospital is managing this automatically</li></ul><h4>Helpful Products</h4><table class=\"faq-table\"><thead><tr><th>Product</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Note</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Coconut Water</td><td>Natural potassium and hydration</td><td>Good for daily use</td></tr><tr><td>ORS / Electral</td><td>Balanced electrolyte replacement</td><td>Keep at home always</td></tr><tr><td>Tomatoes, Bananas</td><td>Natural potassium sources</td><td>Include in regular diet</td></tr><tr><td>Resodium / Adna Tablets</td><td>Treats low sodium</td><td>Prescription only, doctor supervision</td></tr><tr><td>Potassium Syrup</td><td>Treats low potassium</td><td>Use with monitoring as advised</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Key Points to Remember</h4><ul><li>Test monthly, or immediately when symptoms appear</li><li>Drowsiness, coldness, and inactivity can indicate low sodium</li><li>Coconut water and ORS are simple and effective</li><li>Diuretics and BP medications increase the risk of imbalance</li><li>During illness, start ORS right away</li><li>Taste the feeds to check salt content</li><li>Both low and high electrolytes are dangerous - maintain balance</li><li>Prevention is easier than treatment - severe imbalance takes weeks to recover</li></ul>",
