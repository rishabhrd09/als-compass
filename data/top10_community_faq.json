On regular basis. Also used lumis 150.\" - Community member\n- \"Resmed stellar 150 works fine with my father\" - Community member\n- ✅ Has battery backup\n- ✅ Reliable for long-term use\n\n**2. Philips Trilogy 100**\n- \"I used trilogy 100 continuously for 8 yrs, never a time faced any issues and trust it completely. And I bought that in 2016 after seeing all ALS US and worldwide forums which says the most reliable machine is trilogy 100.\" - Community member\n- ✅ Most trusted globally for ALS\n- ✅ 8+ years of reliable use reported\n\n**3. Resmed Lumis 150**\n- \"We are currently using resmed lumis 150\" - Community member\n- ⚠️ No internal battery backup\n- \"Lumis don't have battery backup in my understanding. So make sure you have given the power through a UPS and not usual electricity plug so any fluctuations or blackout in electricity stops the machine.\" - Community member\n\n### 🔀 Decision Matrix:\n**IF** Need reliability + battery backup **→ THEN** Resmed Stellar 150 or Trilogy 100\n**IF** Budget is primary concern **→ THEN** Resmed Lumis 150 (but MUST have UPS)\n**IF** Long-term 24x7 use expected **→ THEN** Philips Trilogy 100 (proven 8+ years)\n\n### ⚠️ Critical Requirement:\nALWAYS have UPS/inverter backup regardless of which machine you buy.

If yes immediately go for PEG or RT. This takes care of nutrition and avoids pneumonia situation. This is most important first decision you need to make.\" - Community member\n\n### Why NOT to Delay:\n\"When PALS are unable to take food properly via mouth, the nutrition amount is insufficient and progression increases faster. With PEG, nutrition amount is proper and progression can be slowed down.\" - Community member\n\n### Critical Timing Factor:\n\"While PEG is the best and comfortable feeding tube for long term, we should also be careful, to get the PEG surgery done at the time when PALS have good respiratory efforts, they should be able to sustain 20 minutes of endoscopy procedure. If not, then it's better to go with Ryles tube or (to undergo tracheostomy first then PEG tube placement). During Endoscopy they cannot use NIV BiPAP, so it becomes life risk if PALS are dependent on BiPAP.\" - Community member\n\n### Can You Still Eat by Mouth After PEG?\n✅ YES!\n- \"Yes, while PEG is there... Can they eat by mouth once in a while?\" → \"Yes after some stage they can't eat by mouth. Early PEG surgery actually helps them to eat by mouth longer. As they have to eat only little.\" - Community member\n- \"When PEG starts, PALS start getting high quality nutrition immediately and it makes a big difference to their health and mood especially because they have been struggling to eat properly for months.\" - Community member\n\n### 🔀 Decision Matrix:\n**IF** Eating takes > 30 minutes for a meal **→ THEN** Discuss PEG immediately\n**IF** Frequent choking during meals **→ THEN** PEG/Ryles is urgent (aspiration pneumonia risk)\n**IF** PALS can still breathe without BiPAP for 20 min **→ THEN** Get PEG now (safer)\n**IF** Already BiPAP dependent **→ THEN** Go with Ryles first, or tracheostomy first then PEG\n\n### Key Insight:\nEarly PEG = Continue eating by mouth for pleasure (no pressure to eat for survival)\nDelayed PEG = Often leads to emergency situation with worse outcomes\n\n### Cost:\n- PEG surgery: ₹15,000-30,000 (one-time)\n- Ryles tube: ₹200-500 (needs replacement every 2-3 weeks)",
